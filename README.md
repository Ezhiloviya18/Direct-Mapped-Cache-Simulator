# Direct Mapped Cache Simulator


Welcome to the Direct Mapped Cache Simulator project! This project demonstrates the simulation of a direct-mapped cache system using Python. It allows you to explore how cache hits and misses are managed based on the cache size, memory size, write policy, and more.

## Introduction

The Direct Mapped Cache Simulator project showcases the functionality of a direct-mapped cache system. This simulator enables you to understand how cache memory interacts with main memory when accessing memory addresses, and how cache hits and misses are handled.

## Features

- **Cache Simulation:** Simulate cache hits and misses for a given memory address.
- **Cache Hit Rate Calculation:** Calculate the hit rate based on simulation results.
- **Cache Miss Rate Calculation:** Calculate the miss rate based on simulation results.

## Usage

1. Run the simulator script as mentioned in the installation instructions.
2. Input cache size, memory size, write policy, write allocation policy, and offset bits.
3. Input the number of memory addresses you want to simulate.
4. Provide memory addresses one by one as prompted.
5. Review the simulation results, including cache hits, misses, hit rate, and miss rate.

## Technologies Used

- Python
